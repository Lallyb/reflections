When would you want to use a remote repository rather than 
keeping all your work local?

  When I want to do collaborative coding
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?

	Because there could be some changes that I may not want in
	my computer's repository
