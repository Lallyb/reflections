When would you want to use a remote repository rather than 
keeping all your work local?

  When I want to do collaborative coding
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?

	Because there could be some changes that I may not want in
	my computer's repository
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

	fork is when you copy one repository whithin GitHub
	clone is when you clone a repository to a remote place
	branch is when you make a change that will not me added to 
	the master
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of 
the remote stored locally?

	In case someone else modify it later, you can have the last 
	known state. So you can make your own changes to it.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would 
be easier, and what would be harder?

	It would be harder to keep track of all the changes
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather 
than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	When I am not sure I want to incorporate the changes in the master
	or want to experiment with the code. Benfits: flexibility
