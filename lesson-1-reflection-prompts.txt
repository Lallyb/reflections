How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because I did not have to compare line by line to find the differences

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will be easier to debug

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I am not sure

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it is easier having all versions in one place

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I don't know

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can rest assure that I will have access to the original file
    if I want to go back to it

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To compare files
	
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

	It would be easier to debug and have programs ready faster
	
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?

	Pro: It is done when you really need it
	Con: It depends on the person who does the commit
	
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because this is very helpful for coding
